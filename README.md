## Tell me more?

Ever wondered if you could use a car instrument cluster outside of your car? Well... the answer to that question is yes. The aim of this project is to give you the ability to run a real instrument cluster from a real car on your desk. The main purpose of this is gaming, but the possibilities are endless. You might want to use it as a clock. Or maybe you want to show the amount of unread emails - possibilities are endless.

Here are a few demo videos of various instrument clusters in action:

## What do I need?
The hardware for this is pretty straightforward. From active electronics you will need:

|ESP32 board| CAN interface | 12V PSU |
|--|--|--|

Or in a bit more details:
 - ESP32 board (I am using a generic Devkit V1 board - available from ebay for around 10€)
 - MCP2515 CAN bus module (I am using a generic one from ebay - available for around 5€)
 - 12V power supply (doesn't have to be too powerful. But 1A or more is probably what you want)
 - Car instrument cluster supported by this project
 - Some wires, pin headers and other stuff to wire everything together
 - An X9C102 (or two) digital potentiometer plus two 1k ohm resistors (for fuel level simulation on some clusters - optional)
 - A Logic Level Shifter (if using E46 cluster)

### Supported instrument clusters
Currently fully tested and supported are the following instrument clusters:

|VW Polo 5| VW Golf 7 | Škoda Superb 2 |
|--|--|--|
| PQ35 | MQB | PQ46 |

| *Fully supported* | *Fully supported* | *Mostly works. Menus don't work, some indicators don't work (ABS, ESP)* |

|VW T-Cross| BMW 5 Series (F10) | BMW 3 Series (F30) 6WA |

| *Do not use! Cluster with Component protection!* | *Fully supported* | *Fully supported* |

| Mini Cooper (third generation, F55/F56/F57)| BMW 5 Series (E60) |  BMW 3 Series (E46) |
|--|--|--|
| BMW F | BMW E |  BMW E46 |

| *Fully supported* | *Mostly supported - WIP - no fuel sim, only some indicators* | *Fully supported - needs specific connections, see wiring* |

For people just starting I would recommend one of the BMW F series clusters or a VW MQB based cluster. If you want to try other clusters from same platform, they will probably work, but modifications might be needed based on the specific car model. If you are unsure if it will work, get the specific clusters mentioned here.

**Newer MQB platform clusters like the T-Cross should be avoided**. After some (unknown) time they will enter into component protection mode which will flash the display and make most of the indicators useless. There is no known solution for this as of yet. I highly recommend you stick to older cars like Golf 7.

You can get these clusters from ebay, your local scrapyard, or if you are in EU: [rrr.lt](rrr.lt/) . No matter where you get them, they should cost you around 50€.

### Supported games
If you want to use the instrument cluster for gaming then currently supported are the following games:

- Forza Horizon 4 (Horizon 5 should also work, as should Forza Motorsport 7)
- BeamNG.drive
- Simhub (not a game but a tool to interface with other games not on this list)
  
## Set it up
### Wiring the main ESP32 board and CAN interface
For wiring you have two options that you can choose. Click on the links below for details:

- [Wiring using the dedicated CarCluster PCB](PCB/README.md)
- [Wiring by using jumper wires/breadboards](Misc/README_WIRING_JUMPERS.md)

For easier wiring I have created a simple breakout PCB that you can use. Simply order the PCBs, solder on some headers and screw terminals, plug in your CAN interface and enjoy. See the link above for more details.

### Wiring your cluster

- [Wiring for VW PQ platform cluster](Misc/README_WIRING_VW_PQ.md)
- [Wiring for VW MQB platform cluster](Misc/README_WIRING_VW_MQB.md)
- [Wiring for BMW F series cluster](Misc/README_WIRING_BMW_F.md)
- [Wiring for BMW E60 cluster](Misc/README_WIRING_BMW_E60.md)
- [Wiring for BMW E46 cluster](Misc/README_WIRING_BMW_E46.md)

### Install the arduino sketch to the ESP32
Download the project and open it using Arduino IDE (I am using version 2.3.3).

If you haven't yet installed ESP32 support for Arduino IDE then do so now. Go to Boards Manager and search for esp32 by Espressif Systems. I am using version 3.0.2.

**Please use arduino ESP32 core versions lower than 3.1.x until further notice as there is an issue with one of the included libraries that prevents the ESP from booting up with wifi enabled. Just install the latest 3.0.x version. Alternatively you can use it with wifi disabled, which should also work.**

There is no need to install any additional libraries. All needed libraries are bundled with this project when you download it.

Now open the `Carcluster.ino` file (arduino sketch) and look for the header `BEGIN USER CONFIGURATION`. At the minimum you need to select your instrument cluster (for example change `#define  CLUSTER  1` to `#define  CLUSTER  3`  in order to use a Golf 7 cluster). Additionally you might want/need to configure some other parameters in this section, but that will depend on your specific cluster. All parameters should be well documented.

Now that you have done that you can compile and install the sketch to your ESP32. Upon starting the ESP will create a wifi network access point called `CarCluster`. Connect to it using your phone/laptop using the password `carcluster`. After you have done that you can open a web browser (if a popup one doesn't open automatically upon connection) and navigate to `192.168.4.1`. This will bring up WifiManager where you can see the networks around you and connect to the one you want. After you do that your ESP will automatically connect to the network you select unless an error occurs in which case the access point will be created again. If you do not configure the wifi network in 3 minutes the ESP will boot in serial only mode that you can use with Simhub. 

*Note that you might have some trouble uploading the code to the ESP32 while the CAN interface is connected. If you do, disconnect the CAN interface and try uploading again.*  

You can also watch a simple step by step video:

### Use the web interface to test the basic functionality

![Web dashboard](https://github.com/r00li/CarCluster/blob/main/Misc/screenshot_dashboard.png?raw=true)
This project contains a small web server that you can use to control some basic functionality of the dashboard. You can set the RPM, speed and some of the other parameters using it. Simply open `http://<ip-of-your-ESP32>/` in your web browser and you should be able to see the above interface. Move the sliders and click the buttons to control the dashboard display.

### Use telemetry data from your game
*For forza Horizon 4/5*:
 1.  Launch the game and proceed through the menus until you can drive your car
 2.  Pause the game and navigate to the Settings menu
 3.  Navigate to HUD and Gameplay
 4.  Set `Data Out` to `ON`
 5.  Set `Data Out IP Address` to `ip-of-your-ESP32`
 6.  Set `Data Out IP Port` to `1101` (or other if you changed the IP in the code)

*For BeamNG.drive:*

 1. Navigate to options
 2. Select `Others`
 3. Scroll down until you find `OutGauge support` and enable it
 4. Set IP address to `ip-of-your-ESP32`
 5. Set port to `1102` (or other if you changed the IP in the code)

Whenever you now run the game you should see the instrument cluster showing the data from the game. 

### Use with Simhub
Simhub support is also included. Simhub can be used in cases where your favourite game isn't supported by this project directly. Simhub support is for now only available through USB connection and not through wifi. 

In order to set this up you will first need to [enable custom serial devices plugin](https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/Custom-serial-devices#enabling-the-plugin) in simhub. After you have done that navigate to the "Custom serial devices" tab on the left and add a new device. Configure it as follows:

![Simhub configuration](https://github.com/r00li/CarCluster/blob/main/Misc/simhub.png?raw=true)

In the Update messages enter the following code:

     '{"action":10' +
     ', "spe":' + truncate(format([SpeedKmh], 0)) + 
     ', "gea":"' + isnull([Gear], 'P') + '"' +
     ', "rpm":' + truncate(isnull([Rpms], 0)) +
     ', "mrp":' + truncate(isnull([MaxRpm], 8000)) +
     ', "lft":' + isnull([TurnIndicatorLeft], 0) +
     ', "rit":' + isnull([TurnIndicatorRight], 0) +
     ', "oit":' + truncate(isnull([OilTemperature], 0)) + 
     ', "pau":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GamePaused], 0) +
     ', "run":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRunning], 0) +
     ', "fue":' + truncate(isnull([DataCorePlugin.Computed.Fuel_Percent], 0)) +
     ', "hnb":' + isnull([Handbrake], 0) +
     ', "abs":' + isnull([ABSActive], 0) +
     ', "tra":' + isnull([TCActive], 0) +
     '}\n'

You can now enjoy CarCluster with any game that is supported by Simhub.


### Other Simhub configuration options
There are also optional keys that you can use in the update messages to control the dashboard. These are:
- `mnl`: Controls the main beam signal.
- `hbl`: Controls the high beam signal.
- `ffl`: Controls the front fog light signal.
- `ign`: Controls the ignition signal.

Below is an example of the configuration you might use for Euro Truck Simulator 2.


     '{"action":10' +
     ', "spe":' + truncate(format([SpeedKmh], 0)) + 
     ', "gea":"' + isnull([Gear], 'P') + '"' +
     ', "rpm":' + truncate(isnull([Rpms], 0)) +
     ', "mrp":' + truncate(isnull([MaxRpm], 8000)) +
     ', "lft":' + isnull([TurnIndicatorLeft], 0) +
     ', "rit":' + isnull([TurnIndicatorRight], 0) +
     ', "oit":' + truncate(isnull([OilTemperature], 0)) + 
     ', "pau":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GamePaused], 0) +
     ', "run":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRunning], 0) +
     ', "fue":' + truncate(isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameData.FuelPercent], 0)) +
     ', "hnb":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRawData.TruckValues.CurrentValues.MotorValues.BrakeValues.ParkingBrake]/1, 0) +
     ', "abs":' + isnull([ABSActive], 0) +
     ', "tra":' + isnull([TCActive], 0) +
     ', "mnl":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRawData.TruckValues.CurrentValues.LightsValues.BeamLow]/1, 0) +
     ', "hbl":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRawData.TruckValues.CurrentValues.LightsValues.BeamHigh]/1, 0) +
     ', "ffl":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameRawData.TruckValues.CurrentValues.LightsValues.Parking]/1, 0) +
     ', "ign":' + isnull([DataCorePlugin.GameData.EngineIgnitionOn], 0) +
     '}\n'
